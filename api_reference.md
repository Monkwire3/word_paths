# WordGraph #
A class that represents a mapping of words to their neighbors. Neighbors are defined as words which are only one addition, subtraction, or substitution away from each other.


### Constructors: ###

- `build_from_file()`


### Attributes: ###

- `graph : dict[str, set[str]]` -- map of words to a set of neighbors


### Functions: ###

- `__init__()`  -- Construct a WordGraph from a list of strings.
	- **Parameters**:
		- `dictionary : list[str]` -- list of words used to generate the graph

- `build_from_file()` -- Constructor. Build a `WordGraph` from a file containing strings, separated by newlines.
	- **Parameters**:
		- `path : str` -- location of source file


# WordPath #
A class that represents a path between two words.

A `WordPath` path is generated by traversing a `WordGraph` using a breadth-first search.


### Attributes: ###
- `start_word : str` -- word that begins a path
- `end_word : str` -- word that ends a path
- `paths : dict[str, str]` -- maps a word to an already visited neighbor
- `queue : deque[str]` -- tracks words that will be visited in a breadth first search
- `graph : WordGraph` -- graph of words that can be traversed to build a `WordPath`

### Functions: ###
-  `__init__()`  -- Construct a `WordPath`.
	-  **Parameters**:
		- `start_word : str` -- word that begins a path
		- `end_word : str` -- word that ends a path
		- `graph : WordGraph` -- graph that can be traversed to build a `WordPath`
- `find_one_step()`  -- Advance one step in a breadth-first search.
- `get_path()` -- Return an array with the shortest path between two words.
