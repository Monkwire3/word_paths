# WordPaths API Reference #

## WordGraph ##
A class that represents a mapping of words to their neighbors.


## Constructors: ##

`build_from_file()`


## Attributes: ##

`graph : dict[str, set[str]]`

map of words to a list of their neighors


## Functions: ##


### `__init__()` ###

Construct a WordGraph from a list of strings.


#### Parameters: ####

`dictionary : list[str]`

List of words used to generate the graph


### build_from_file() ###
Constructor. Build a WordGraph from a file.

Files are expected to contain a list of strings, separated by newlines.


#### Parameters: ####

`path : str`
  location of source file


## WordPath ##
A class that represents a path between two words.

A WordPath path is generated by traversing a WordGraph using a breadth-first search.


### Attributes: ###

`start_word : str`

word that begins a path

---
`end_word : str`

word that ends a path

---

`paths : dict[str, str]`

maps a word to the its neighbor previous in the path

---

`queue : deque[str]`

tracks words that will be visited in a breadth first search

---

`graph : WordGraph`

graph of words that can be travesed to build a WordPath

### `__init__()` ###
Construct a WordPath.


#### Parameters: ####
`start_word : str`

word that begins a path

---

`end_word : str`

word that ends a path

---

`graph : WordGraph`
graph that can be travered to build a WordPath


### `find_one_step()` ###
Advance one step in a breadth first search.

Update self.queue and self.paths.

### get_path() ###
Find the shortest bath between two words. Returns an array with the shortest path.

Paths only include words from the graph.
